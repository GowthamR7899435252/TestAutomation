public interface WebDriver
extends SearchContext
WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents (browsers). The methods in this interface fall into three categories:
Control of the browser itself
Selection of WebElements
Debugging aids
Key methods are get(String), which is used to load a new web page, and the various methods similar to findElement(By), which is used to find WebElements.
Currently, you will need to instantiate implementations of this interface directly. It is hoped that you write your tests against this interface so that you may "swap in" a more fully featured browser when there is a requirement for one.
Most implementations of this interface follow W3C WebDriver specification
